# Hydra playground

This is my little experiment playing with [Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra),
the OAuth2 token server.

Bring infrastructure up with `./start.sh` and visit http://localhost:9030/.

* Hydra: https://localhost:9000
* Consent app: http://localhost:9020
* Consumer app: http://localhost:9030
* API: http://localhost:9040

Tear everything down with `./kill.sh`
